# Embedded-C
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensor endpoint. The sensor is capable of communicating with a management controller over Ethernet using a RESTful API, measuring temperature readings at a programmable interval of time, and providing rudimentary error logging capabilities. This focuses on integration, sensor hysteresis, and the watchdog timer.
